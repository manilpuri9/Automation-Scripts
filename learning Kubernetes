# concepts and doubts
We use Terraform to set up our AWS cloud resources (instances, network routes, DNS records, etc). 
Our cloud and physical nodes run Ubuntu and are configured with Chef. 
For faster spinup times, we pre-bake our cluster AMIs using Packer. 
All our clusters use non-overlapping IP ranges and are interconnected over the public internet 
with OpenVPN on user laptops, and strongSwan on physical nodes (which act as AWS Customer Gateways).
